# mad-libs-mermaid-generator
A basic application where the user describes what the desired generated flowchart should be about Ex. PEMDAS. Then they put in the amount of nodes and edges they want in the flowchart. Then they can push the button generate flowchart which will send a request to openai api to make plain mermaid code to be generated back into the website as an svg. it varies in shape color position of shapes etc... They can also push the handdrawn button which sends a request to the openai api to give a list description of the nodes (color,shape,what it says) and you pick where the nodes go and the edges. You can then hand draw either the already generated flowchart. Or you could draw out the one that is described and then you can upload the photo you took. But since my computer is just the server it will only upload the file to my computer
