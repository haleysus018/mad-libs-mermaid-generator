# mad-libs-mermaid-generator
Generates a mermaid svg based on the described topic and amount of nodes and edges. You can also just have it give a list of nodes and have you be creative. Then you can upload your photo of the flowchart you drew but it only uploads to my computer since my computer is the server.
